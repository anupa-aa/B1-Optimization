# B1 Optimization Notes

## Source Content
These notes come from the **Oxford Engineering Science Third Year course 'B1 Computation'** which covers content on optimization, finite element analysis and numerical algorithms (hopefully all of which will be uploaded to my github).

For the optimization part, the course recommends the book **"Practical Optimization" by Philip E. Gill, Walter Murray and Margarat H. Wright**. Our lecturer, the wonderful Prof V A Prisacariu, is also particularly fond of the book **"Numerical Recipes in C"**.

I will primarily therefore be writing code in C, but converting to Python should be simple and I will provide the Python code as well. For the ease of making notes associated with it, I will be using jupyter notebook files for both Python and the C code (using clang).
